## Configuration

### Enabling Providers

1. Navigate to Settings > Integrations > Subtitle Providers
2. Toggle providers on/off
3. Configure API keys where required:
   - OpenSubtitles: Requires API key
   - SubDL: Optional API key for higher limits
4. Set provider priority order (drag to reorder)

### Provider Priority

When searching for subtitles, Cinephage queries providers in priority order:

1. Searches top-priority provider first
2. If no match found, moves to next provider
3. Continues until match found or all providers exhausted

Reorder providers based on your preference and success rates.

## Language Profiles

Language profiles define which subtitle languages to search for and in what order.

### Creating a Profile

1. Navigate to Settings > Integrations > Language Profiles
2. Click "Add Profile"
3. Add languages in priority order
4. Configure options:
   - Hearing impaired preference
   - Foreign parts only (for forced subtitles)
5. Save the profile

### Example Profile

A typical English speaker might configure:

1. English (primary)
2. English (Hearing Impaired)
3. Spanish (backup)

### Assigning Profiles

Assign language profiles to:

- All content (default profile)
- Specific movies
- Specific series
- Individual episodes (for foreign language episodes)

---

## Automatic Search

Enable automatic subtitle search when media is imported.

### How It Works

1. Media file is imported to library
2. Cinephage identifies the movie or episode
3. Searches configured providers using language profile
4. Downloads best matching subtitle
5. Saves alongside media file

### Configuration

Enable in **Settings > Tasks**:

- **Auto-search on import**: Enable/disable automatic subtitle search
- **Search trigger**: When to search for subtitles during import
  - `After metadata` (default): Search after TMDB matching completes
  - `Immediate`: Search as soon as file is imported
  - `Both`: Search at both stages
- **Minimum score**: Only download if match confidence is high enough (set per language profile)

---

## Manual Search

Search for subtitles manually from media detail pages:

1. Navigate to the movie or episode
2. Click "Search Subtitles"
3. Review results from all providers
4. Select and download preferred subtitle

Results show:

- Provider source
- Language
- Release name match
- Hearing impaired indicator
- Download count (where available)

## Supported Languages

150+ languages including regional variants:

### Major Languages

### Language Codes

Cinephage supports both:

- ISO 639-2 (3-letter codes): eng, spa, fra

---

## Embedded Subtitle Support

Cinephage recognizes embedded subtitles within video containers (MKV, MP4, etc.) and counts them toward language profile satisfaction.

### How It Works

1. During media analysis, Cinephage extracts subtitle track information from the video file using ffprobe
2. Embedded languages are stored in `mediaInfo.subtitleLanguages`
3. When checking if a language profile is satisfied, both external subtitle files AND embedded tracks are considered
4. If embedded subs match a required language, no external download is triggered

### Benefits

- **No redundant downloads**: Files with built-in subtitles won't trigger unnecessary searches
- **Accurate status display**: UI shows both embedded and external subtitles
- **Profile flexibility**: Mix embedded and external subtitles to satisfy profiles

### Limitations

- Embedded subtitles are treated as non-forced, non-hearing-impaired
- If you specifically need forced or HI subtitles, external downloads may still be triggered
- Language code normalization converts 3-letter codes (eng, fre) to 2-letter (en, fr)

### Visual Distinction

In the UI, embedded subtitles are displayed with their language codes alongside external subtitle files. The system merges both sources to show a complete subtitle inventory for each file.

## Subtitle Management

### File Naming

Subtitles are saved alongside media files:

```
Movie.Name.2023.1080p.BluRay.mkv
Movie.Name.2023.1080p.BluRay.en.srt        # English
Movie.Name.2023.1080p.BluRay.es.srt        # Spanish
Movie.Name.2023.1080p.BluRay.en.hi.srt     # English (Hearing Impaired)
```

### History

View subtitle download history:

- Downloaded subtitles per media item
- Provider used
- Download date
- Manual vs automatic

### Blacklist

Blacklist poor quality subtitles:

1. From subtitle history, click "Blacklist"
2. Subtitle won't be downloaded again
3. Future searches skip blacklisted items

## Rate Limiting

Each provider has built-in rate limiting:

| Provider      | Limit                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| OpenSubtitles | 20/day (free), 200/day (VIP) |
| Addic7ed      | 40/day                       |
| SubDL         | 100/hour                     |
| Others        | Provider-specific            |

Cinephage automatically respects these limits and queues requests when needed.
